## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** ReactJS, Firebase, Spotify API, Context API

Creating a Spotify look-a-like, I focused on Spotify's sleek design with the possibility to scale and incorporate system design patterns. Using the BEM naming convention, I created efficient arrow function components and custom hooks for state management. You can sign up, sign in, review your playlists, and see your up-to-date suggested music in Discover Weekly!


## Lessons Learned:

I learned that prop drilling is not helpful when using Context API paradigm.

## Examples:

Take a look at these couple examples that I have in my own portfolio:
